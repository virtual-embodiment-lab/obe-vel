# OBEProject: Perspective Shifts in VR (OBE) 2025 Pilot

This repository contains a Unity-based virtual reality environment developed for the Virtual Embodiment Lab. The project facilitates pilot studies on acute pain management and out-of-body experiences by integrating immersive avatar creation, real-time thermode assessments, and controlled perspective-shifting simulations.

## Features
- **Immersive VR Experience:** Engage in a fully interactive lab environment.
- **Thermode Integration:** Measure and record acute pain thresholds during experiments.
- **Avatar Customization:** Generate personalized avatars via selfie capture and ReadyPlayerMe.
- **Structured Protocol:** Follow a detailed experimental script ensuring standardized procedures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Unity:** Version 2022.3.24f1 (or compatible)
- **VR Hardware:** Oculus Quest 2 (with Quest Link)
- **Thermode Device:** For pain assessment during experiments

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/virtual-embodiment-lab/obe-vel.git
   Open in Unity:
2. **Use Unity Hub to open the project.**
3. **Configure Settings:**
- Ensure all necessary packages are installed via the Unity Package Manager.

### Running the Experiment
- Setup: Follow the lab protocol for hardware and software configuration.
- Scene Selection: Open the Main Scene in Unity.
- Execution: Start the experiment, guiding participants through avatar creation, thermode tasks, and perspective-shifting activities.
 -Data Collection: The environment supports real-time logging of experiment data for subsequent analysis.

## Experimental Protocol
The project is designed to:
- Safeguard participant wellbeing with pre-experiment consent and screening.
- Facilitate immersive experiences that range from embodiment to controlled disembodiment.
- Integrate post-experience surveys and automated data capture for research purposes.
